# DarkCastle

*** Warning the ciphers contained in this program are still undergoing cryptanalysis

*** Warning: this product is for non-production use.  If you want production level crypto, use OpenSSL or libsodium

DarkCastle is an authenticated file encryption program aiming to provide a large collection of community ciphers.  This program is intended for educational use until full cryptanalysis can be completed.

DarkCastle allows for general file encryption or file exchange between two people using Q'loQ public keys.

*** Works on Linux, MacOS

# Algorithms and authenticators

All ciphers, with the exception of Specjal and Zywca which are still undergoing testing, are recommended ciphers.  The top two recommended stream ciphers are Qapla and Amagus and the top two block ciphers are ZanderFish3 and ZanderFish2.

Fastest cipher is Uvajda

Uvajda 256 bit authenticated with Ganja 256 bit - 128 bit nonce length
