*** Warning the ciphers contained in this program are still undergoing cryptanalysis

*** Warning: this product is for non-production use.  If you want production level crypto, use OpenSSL or libsodium

DarkCastle is an authenticated file encryption program aiming to provide a large collection of community ciphers.  This program is intended for educational use until full cryptanalysis can be completed.

DarkCastle allows for general file encryption or file exchange between two people using Curve25519 ECC public keys.

*** Works on Linux, MacOS
